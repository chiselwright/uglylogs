Tag file.

Lists the tags and the broad changes made.  Please update everytime a new
release goes live on the main game. This way we can always pull out the correct
version. In reverse order.  Leave the Name: tag at the top of the file to get
the correct release tag embedded in the game when you build it.

Addendum: As you commit code, please put information about the changes in above
the latest release tag. That way if someone else does a release, the change
information doesn't get lost.
