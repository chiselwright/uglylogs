UglyLOGs

Take a look at test/log-send-test-mail. This is probably almost exactly what is
required to parse, process, and email player and admin logs.

You'll need to change the paths in the script - it's unlikely your set-up will
match mine exactly.

Also, if you don't cahnge the test_mail_to address, I will hunt you down and fill
your shoes with cold custard. I don't want your test emails. Thanks for the offer.



== DATA ==

I've removed all data from admin.info and email.list that don't relate to me.
It would be very bad of me to publish a whole bunch of details like that
for anyone to help themselves to.

I've left my details in as an example of the format. I assume you have a suitable
user base that you can use instead of this.

If you wish to change admin.info:

 bash# cd bin
 bash# ./log_recipient_config

I'll admit it's hacky, and doesn't handle everything as well as it should,
but it is a working CLI to change the settings.




== Perl Modules / CPAN ==

As the 'appropriate' user (probably root):

 bash# cp lib/Bundle/UglyMUG.pm ~/.cpan/Bundle/

You should then be able to run cpan and

 cpan> install Bundle::UglyMUG
